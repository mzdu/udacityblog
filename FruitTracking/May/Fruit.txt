I found it is a bit of hard to seriously sit down and study.
Besides, it is hard to track what I had done in the past day.

But I will keep on recording the fruit I picked, 
in order to improve my efficiency of the next day.

Fruit: 
	Hashing with GAE
	Bascially finished the main content of Udacityblog that is related to my wikitheoria development
		although Memcache and finshing part is also important, but I will finish it later.
	Checked Vidal's video:
		1. Datastore
		2. Many-to-many relationship
	
Improvement: I need to write my ideas down for the following reasons,
1. help myself to track my fruit
2. I am going to need to use some paragraphs some day.
3. It will hugely help me on my paper writing.
4. Look at how many papers your friends had published.
5. It is not about how much preparation you had done, 
		it is about how much REAL progress you had made. Please record it down.
